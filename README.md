# Line Following Robot ü§ñ

This repository contains the code for a line following robot. It includes the following files:

- `motor-control.ino` üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è: Code for controlling the robot's motors.
- `rpm-counter.ino` üîÑ: Code for measuring the RPM (rotations per minute) of the robot's wheels.
- `ir-sensor-detection.ino` üîç: Code to check the IR sensor detection with 16 sensors.
- `encoder-wheel-to-degree.ino` ‚öôÔ∏è: Code for measuring and converting wheel turns into degrees.

## Usage üöÄ

1. Turn on the robot and ensure a stable Wi-Fi connection (muibee SSID).
2. Open the Arduino IDE (version 1.8 is recommended) and navigate to "Sketch" > "Export compiled Binary" (Ctrl+Alt+S).
3. Locate the generated .bin file in the Arduino directory.
4. Visit http://robotorange.sytes.net/ and provide your name, NPM, and description.
5. Upload the .ino and .bin files using the designated field and run the code!
